## DESCRIPTION:

This is a simple project to keep me learning and practicing. In the beginning of my fullstack bootcamp I made a simple password generator out of HTML, CSS, and plain vanilla Javascript. And it was a fantastic exercise! I felt the right amount of challenge at the time. So at this stage of learning Rust, I wanted to attempt the same challenge. I chose Tauri so I could practice some SvelteKit on the frontend, some basic Rust on the backend, and build my first desktop app at the same time.

I am happy to say the developer experience was really great! I look forward to trying more difficult projects using these tools in the future.
