## DESCRIPTION:

This is a simple project to keep me learning and practicing. In the beginning of my fullstack bootcamp I made a simple password generator out of HTML, CSS, and plain vanilla Javascript. And it was a fantastic exercise! I felt the right amount of challenge at the time. So at this stage of learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I wanted to attempt the same challenge.     

I chose [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) so I could keep using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) on the frontend, practice some very basic Rust on the backend, and build my first desktop app at the same time. I also utilized [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/), a UI toolkit for SvelteKit and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), to keep the frontend development simple.

I am happy to say the developer experience was really great! I look forward to trying more difficult projects using these tools in the future.

## INSTALLATION:

The source code is open source and right above. Anybody is free to clone the repo, install the dependencies, and build it.

I could use GitHub to host my latest builds... but lets be real, I'm never going to need to update this.   

So I will just have the installers available to download from my [my website](https://lawhornmatt.com/)-- once I finish reworking it. I'll update this section when that is available

## USAGE:

Choose at least one character option (passwords can be built from lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters, or any combination thereof) and a password length via slider and hit the generate password button.
