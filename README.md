## DESCRIPTION:

This is the ReadMe for Matty Lawhorn's project titled: SuprPassGen

This is a simple project to keep me learning Svelte for frontend and Rust for backend. In the beginning of my fullstack bootcamp I made a simple password generator out of HTML, CSS, and plain vanilla Javascript. And it was a fantastic excersize; at that level of experience I felt the right amount of challenge and ease. So at this stage of learning Rust, I wanted to attempt the same challenge. Edit this later to mention it uses Tauri to tie it all together.
